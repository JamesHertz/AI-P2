We've implemented the an local search Algorithm called simulated annealing.
The challenged was that it was supposeed to dynamic and to ask the user for the parameters it wants to use and a set of other things.

It's done but I think I will have to handle some litte things.
The is generic enough to be used in anything but here we are using it in the travelling salesman problem.
